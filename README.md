### Motivation

I want to write clean, sustainable, well-defined boundary context, well-tested domain code and isolate business logic from external concerns. Hexagonal architecture allows us to become domain software, which is a very comfortable way to change technology because it provides a loosely couple environment without the technical details of the project, and it also prepares our monolith-starting project for micro-servicers
